          Since a young age I have had a penchant for exploration, whether it be physical adventure or mental growth and it has driven me to extraordinary places. During my time at Gonzaga University in Spokane, WA, I made the most of the opportunities presented to me. Graduating with a BA in Psychology and a concentration in leadership studies, I relished exploring behavior, as well as new places, spending a total of 7 months (3 summer sessions) researching chimpanzees and volunteering in Zambia.

          This passion extended past my studies, putting my leadership skills and outdoors experiences as an Eagle Scout to use, getting certified as an adventure guide and working in retail sales in the outdoor industry, first in the US and later in New Zealand and Australia. During those years I lived and worked with people from around the globe and every walk of life, acquiring a talent for communicating with people from diverse backgrounds in effective and meaningful ways.

          I was so moved by these experiences that I wanted to learn more of the world, training as an ESL (English as a Second Language) teacher, I moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina. The two years I spent in Argentina not only enabled me to become fluent in Spanish, but also opened my eyes to new ways of thinking, creative ways of solving problems. Teaching English was an invaluable experience because it taught me how to explain complex concepts clearly, communicate effectively with language limitations all while developing as a public speaker.

          Ever since I started playing with computers and dabbling in code, I have found them fascinating. I love puzzles, solving problems and learning new things, and the very nature of coding as an every-changing environment that uses logic to solve real-world problems really encompasses those passions. I relish the opportunity to continue to grow and learn every day as I explore the ever-dynamic world of code, all while building tangible products to improve peopleâ€™s lives.
